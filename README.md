# 2Note
2Note is a minimalistic note taking app for your browser (you can even run as a plain HTML, using in-browser storage). It allows you to keep multiple plain text notes and even lets you use the tab key (yay!).

It's still in early development, but you can [try it here](http://staudt.github.io/2Note).

Why "2Note"? Well, 2Note is one note more than OneNote ;)
