# 2Note
2Note is a minimalistic note taking app for your browser (you can even run as a plain HTML, using in-browser storage). It allows you to keep multiple plain text notes and even lets you use the tab key (YAY!).

Develoment has just started, so it is not very usable right now.

Why "2Note"? Well, 2Note is one note more than OneNote ;)
