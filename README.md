# 2Note
2Note is minimal note taking app for your browser (you can even run as a plain HTML, using in-browser storage).

It allows you to keep multiple notes and even lets you use the tab key (YAY!).

Develoment has just started, so it is not very usable right now.

Why "2Note"? Well, MS has OneNote, so 2Note is one more ;)
